-> Created a new repo named node-sails-chat.

-> Created a remote master branch

-> Researched about Sails framework and understood that it is like what rails is to ruby.

-> Generated the models and controllers. Realized that the generation is similar to Rails.

-> Opened up the route file and added the necessary routes required for the project.

-> Opened up the models and added the attributes respectively.

-> Created the required actions in the Main Controller.

-> When res.view() is called, Sails will look for the file in the following pattern views -> controllerName -> filename.ejs

-> By default the layout.ejs is rendered. We can call specific layouts by using res.view( { layout: "other.ejs" } )
